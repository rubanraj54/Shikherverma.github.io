Recently I have downgraded my Ubuntu version from 16.04 to 14.04 and suddenly i have seen that there was no WIFi options available under networking. I have gone through many websites to solve this issue, but no luck for more than two hours. But finally, I found solution from one stackoverflow post, but that didnâ€™t give complete solution. On top of the stackoverflow solution, I did few more steps to solve this solution.


WIFI problem faced under following hardware and software configuration:

```
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64 bit version

WIFI device - Qualcomm Atheros Device

Lenovo Thinkpad E470 - i5 7th Gen
```

That concludes our ButterKnife source code diving! Hopefully this would motivate you to read the source code of the libraries you are using and stop treating them as black boxes. If you are interested in getting better at source code diving see : [http://wiki.c2.com/?TipsForReadingCode](http://wiki.c2.com/?TipsForReadingCode). You can use this new knowledge of annotations and code generation to remove boilerplate code from your apps by writing your own libraries.
